# Falafel Open Games Manifesto

## We make games with freedom inside.

**Falafel Open Games** is a small collective of indie developers who believe that creativity thrives where code is open, art is shared, and ethics matter.
We build games for the web and for your brand — games that are fun, honest, and free in every sense of the word.

## 1. Freedom is our foundation.

We work exclusively with **free and open-source technologies**: engines, tools, and assets released under licenses like **MIT, CC0, and OFL**.
When you hire Falafel Open Games, you’re not just getting a deliverable — you’re sponsoring **software freedom**.  
No lock-ins. No proprietary traps.

Everything we make belongs to the commons, including your commissioned project.
You own it, the world can learn from it, and it will keep running long after the contract ends.

## 2. Play comes first.

Fun is not an afterthought — it’s the reason we make games.
We design experiences that are intuitive, balanced, and full of personality.

We won’t hand you a soulless *advergame* or a lazy clone.
We’ll help you find the **playful essence** that fits your brand’s message — and we’ll fight to make it something we’d actually enjoy playing ourselves.
If it’s not fun, it’s not finished.

## 3. Fast, fair, and focused.

By standing on the shoulders of giants — the global open-source community — we move fast and keep costs honest.
We believe **small-scope games** can have **big impact**, and we’re not afraid of ambitious ideas either.

Whether you need a tiny interactive toy or a full-featured indie release, we’ll help you balance scope, budget, and speed without sacrificing quality or ethics.

## In Summary

Like a falafel, our work is handmade, nutritious, and best when shared.
Each project is a small, crunchy bite of creativity — prepared with care, seasoned with open culture, and meant to be enjoyed by everyone.

*Open source. Playful spirit. Ethical code.*
